# Client CRM

Client CRM is a production-oriented SaaS sales workspace platform built with **Next.js App Router** and **PostgreSQL + Prisma**.

It helps teams manage leads, meetings, follow-ups, documents, team collaboration, and internal rewards/workflow scoring from one interface.  
The app is designed for **workspaces / organizations** with role-based access, notification flow, and subscription-aware limits.

- Track meetings, follow-ups, and activities with clear status/priority/risk signals
- Route support/help requests across teams and keep everything tenant-safe
- Handle document upload, storage, and traceability across company interactions
- Run a scoring and rewards system for productivity/engagement with wallets, badges, and rewards
- Provide team and workspace administration with roles, permissions, and invitations
- Offer analytics, charts, and leaderboard views for performance visibility
- Provide global search and activity notifications
- Include secure auth with migration-friendly architecture (Better Auth + NextAuth compatibility layer)

## Getting Started

### Login-free access

The CRM opens directly at `/dashboard` without a sign-in. On first use it creates an
`Open CRM Workspace` and a shared `open-access@crm.local` user. Every visitor to the
same deployment can view and change that workspace's data, so use this mode only
where shared access is intended. The shared user has workspace administrator
permissions, but no platform administrator access. PostgreSQL must be configured
and its schema migrated before the first visit.

Set both `OPEN_ACCESS_ENABLED=false` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPEN_ACCESS_ENABLED=false`
to restore the existing sign-in flow. Restart the app after changing these values.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+  
- PostgreSQL 13+
- pnpm/npm/yarn (project uses npm scripts)

### 1) Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankur-datta-official/client-crm.git
cd client-crm
npm install
```

### 2) Environment

Create `.env.local` (or copy from examples):

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then set at least:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `AUTH_PROVIDER=betterauth` (default auth mode used in current release)
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROVIDER`
- Upload settings (`UPLOAD_DIR`, `PRIVATE_UPLOAD_DIR`, `TEMP_UPLOAD_DIR`, `PUBLIC_UPLOAD_BASE_URL`)
- Optional email/cron variables: `SMTP_*`, `CRON_SECRET`, `REMINDER_EMAIL_ENABLED`

### 3) Database and Prisma

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
```

If you need schema status:

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate:status
```

### 4) Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

- `http://localhost:3000/auth/login`
- `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
- `http://localhost:3000/companies`
- `http://localhost:3000/reports`

---

## Useful scripts

- `npm run dev` – start development server
- `npm run build` – production build
- `npm run start` – run built app
- `npm run lint` – lint code
- `npm run typecheck` – TypeScript type check
- `npm run prisma:generate` – generate Prisma client
- `npm run prisma:migrate` – run Prisma migration in dev mode
- `npm run prisma:migrate:status` – check migration status
- `npm run data:migrate:supabase` – migrate Supabase live data to current schema
- `npm run prisma:check-coverage` – validate Prisma migration schema coverage
- `npm run db:check-schema-parity` – verify schema parity against references
- `npm run db:repair-local-schema` – repair parity issues (with `--apply`)

---

## Security and access model

- Workspace/organization data is tenant scoped.
- Routes under authenticated area use server-session guarded layouts.
- Notifications, invitations, documents, team actions, and sensitive mutations are server-driven via guarded API/actions.
- Cron-related endpoints are protected using `CRON_SECRET`.
- Inactive users are blocked from normal operation flows.

---

## API highlights

This codebase includes structured route groups for:

- `/api/auth` – authentication handlers (including reset/forgot/register flows)
- `/api/scoring` – scoring and wallet operations
- `/api/search` – search APIs
- `/api/health` – health checks
- `/api/storage` – document/avatar upload helpers
- `/api/import` – company import tooling
- `/api/cron` – scheduled/background job triggers

---

## Docs and migration references

The repo includes operational docs for migration and verification:

- `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
- `docs/full-postgres-migration-status.md`
- `docs/storage-migration.md`
- `docs/production-test-checklist.md`
- `docs/rollback-plan.md`

---

## Deployment notes

- Build checks to run before deploy:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run build`
- Set production environment values from `.env.production.example`
- Ensure database and auth base URLs align with your production domain
- Keep `DATABASE_URL` and secret keys out of version control and rotate periodically
